			<p> Hello! My name is Aji Bennett and I am learning to become a software developer. I want to one day, build a website that generates passive income for me. The traditional 9-5 job does not appeal to the kind of life style that I would like to live. Learning code is a stepping stone for me achieving my goals

			<p>Being creative has always seemed harder than it really is. I'm hoping to gain some designing skills while im enrolled in the <a href="www.Blue1647.com">Blue1647</a> coding course. I will master these new skills and put them to good use.
